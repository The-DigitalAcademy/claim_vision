Project Name: ClaimVision â€“ Predictive Insurance Insights

Description: The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months. This solution will help streamline financial planning at AutoInland (an Insurance company in west Africa with a focus on Auto Insurance) and allow them to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are likely to submit a claim.

Target Market: The model will be built for the Claims Management team and the Customer Service department. The model will help these teams anticipate and manage the volume of claims, ensuring they have the necessary resources to handle them efficiently. Additionally, it will support the Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) team by providing insights into future claims, helping them allocate budgets and resources more effectively.
