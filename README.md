Project Name: ClaimVision â€“ Predictive Insurance Insights

Description: The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months. This solution will help streamline financial planning at AutoInland (an Insurance company in west Africa with a focus on Auto Insurance) and allow them to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are likely to submit a claim.
